# React Native Elements App

This is the Demo app for [React Native Elements UI kit](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements) built with [Expo](https://expo.io/). In this app you will find examples on how to use various components as well as Production-ready screens which showcase how to combine multiple components to built entire views in your app.

This repo uses React Native Elements as a submodule through `/node_modules/react-native-elements`. Hence once you clone this repo, you can make changes to any RNE `/src` files, test these changes through this example app and also commit directly to the main RNE repo.
